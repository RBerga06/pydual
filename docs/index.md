# Dual numbers and uncertainties

`pydual` provides an implementation of autodifferentiation with dual numbers
that allows to effortlessly model and propagate uncertainties through calculations.

## Future directions

`pydual` aims to implement the following features:

- Custom/arbitrary error distribution (currently it implicitely only supports normal distributions)
- Full [Array API](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/) support
