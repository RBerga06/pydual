> GitHub (now Microsoft's) and OpenAI train AI models like Copilot and ChatGPT over open source projects.
> Very often, those AI models tend to copy code verbatim that was present in their training dataset,
> without reporting attribution. This is an explicit violation of open-source licenses (there is an open [court case](https://githubcopilotlitigation.com/) on that).
>
> Because of this, I (creator and, as of now, sole maintainer of this project) have decided to transfer the project to Codeberg.
> They cannot guarantee that LLMs won't have access to the source code (no one can), but at least they don't try and actively make it easier.
